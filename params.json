Unless, of course, you want to make a plugin to allow users to change their own login and admin branding.\r\n\r\nClients like seeing their names and logos on things. The above features seems to have made some of my own clients happy, so I thought I'd share them!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, grab the code.  You can do this with git:\r\n\r\n    $ cd /your/theme/directory\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/chrisguitarguy/WP-Custom-Admin-Branding.git branding\r\n\r\nOr you can download the [zipball](https://github.com/chrisguitarguy/WP-Custom-Admin-Branding/zipball/master).\r\n\r\nNext up, drop a few lines of code in your `functions.php`.\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n    // somewhere in `functions.php`\r\n    require_once( trailingslashit( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) .
